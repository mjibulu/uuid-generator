# UUID v4 & v7 Generator

Generate, format, copy, download, and inspect bounded batches of UUIDv4 or time-ordered UUIDv7 identifiers in the browser.

This is a complete standalone browser application. It does not require eBURP,
an account, a server-side API, or a private runtime.

## Features

- Cryptographically random UUIDv4 and time-ordered UUIDv7 generation
- Batch presets and bounded custom counts
- Canonical, compact, braced, JSON, SQL, line, and comma formats
- Batch uniqueness reporting, copy, and download
- UUID validation with version, variant, and timestamp inspection

## Browser support and limitations

The current stable releases of Chromium, Firefox, and Safari are supported.
Some browser capabilities vary by platform. Camera and microphone access
requires HTTPS or localhost, clipboard access may require a user gesture, and
fullscreen or output-device selection may not be available in every browser.
The tool remains usable where a non-essential capability is unavailable.

## Run locally

Requirements:

- Node.js 24.x
- Corepack

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev
```

## Verify

Fast checks:

```bash
pnpm run check
```

Complete browser verification:

```bash
pnpm run verify
```

## Build and host

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Upload the contents of `dist/` to a static host. The application supports both
root and subdirectory hosting and needs no environment variables.

The same output can be deployed with GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages,
Vercel static hosting, or an ordinary file upload. No provider-specific
runtime, account integration, or server-side function is required by the
application.

## Data and network behaviour

The upstream application ships without analytics or telemetry. Tool processing
occurs in the browser, and the primary browser tests fail unexpected external
requests. See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for the repository-specific storage
and browser API inventory.
